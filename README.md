## Problem Description
    In this project, I am wanting to visualize the air pollution (AQI) levels of cities of my choosing. For my cities, I picked my hometown and neighboring cities. When analyzing the data of AQI change throughout various years,
    I am able to ask what the main cause of the pollution is, if its improved in the past 5 years, and even what the impact of COVID-19 had on air quality.
