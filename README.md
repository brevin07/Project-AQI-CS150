## Thesis Statement
    Fire-prone regions with significantly higher AQI levels due to wildfires should recieve increased fire prevention resources to reduce air pollution and protect public health.

## Context for Data Visualization
    In this project, I am wanting to visualize the air pollution (AQI) levels of cities of my choosing. For my cities, I picked my hometown and neighboring cities. When analyzing the data of AQI change throughout various years,
    I am able to ask what the main cause of the pollution is, if its improved in the past 5 years, and even what the impact of COVID-19 had on air quality.

## Data Visualization Strategies
    For this visualization, having two dropdown menus--one for the year and one for the site location--is crucial. The ability to adjust the year allows us to observe changes in AQI levels over time, while selecting a specific 
    site location helps analyze AQI changes in different areas. This interactive method provides a clearer understanding of how AQI levels flucuate based on both time and area.

## Conclusion
    By visualizing the AQI data of Northern California cities from years 2016-2022, there is a noticable trend of higher AQI levels during fire season. By knowing this, we can call to higher authorities and voice how 
    fire prevention strategies are needed to not only save houses and lives, but save our long-term health as well.
